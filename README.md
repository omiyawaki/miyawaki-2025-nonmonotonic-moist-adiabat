# Supporting data and scripts for "The non-monotonicity of moist adiabatic warming"

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks used to perform the analysis and generate the figures for the manuscript "The non-monotonicity of moist adiabatic warming," submitted to the *Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences*.

## Overview

The manuscript presents a thermodynamic theory explaining the non-monotonic response of moist adiabatic warming to changes in surface temperature. The theory decomposes the sensitivity of the moist adiabatic lapse rate into two competing components: a Cooling Term and a Pressure Term. It shows that their different scaling with temperature explains the non-monotonic behavior. This repository provides the code to reproduce the key results and figures that illustrate this mechanism and its implications for convective buoyancy and vertical velocity.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains one Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) for each figure in the manuscript. Each notebook is standalone and can be run independently to generate the corresponding figure.

* `Figure_1.ipynb`: Generates Figure 1, showing the non-monotonic temperature response of a moist adiabat.
* `Figure_2.ipynb`: Generates Figure 2, which decomposes the total sensitivity of the lapse rate into the Cooling and Pressure Terms.
* `Figure_3.ipynb`: Generates Figure 3, illustrating the competing contributions of the Cooling and Pressure Terms to the total warming profile.
* `Figure_4.ipynb`: Generates Figure 4, showing the spatial structure of the prefactors for the Cooling and Pressure Terms.
* `Figure_5.ipynb`: Generates Figure 5, calculating the non-monotonic buoyancy profiles.
* `Figure_6.ipynb`: Generates Figure 6, decomposing the total buoyancy into contributions from the Cooling and Pressure terms.
* `Figure_7.ipynb`: Generates Figure 7, calculating the non-monotonic vertical velocity profiles.
* `Figure_8.ipynb`: Generates Figure 8, decomposing the total vertical velocity into components driven by the Cooling and Pressure terms.
* `Figure_A1.ipynb`: Generates Figure A1, demonstrating the non-monotonic warming in pressure coordinates.
